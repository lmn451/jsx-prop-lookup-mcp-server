# MCP Server Integration Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive integration tests to ensure the jsx-analyzer MCP server works correctly and prevent regression of the original Babel traverse import issue.

## Test Coverage Added

### 1. Babel Traverse Import Regression Tests (4 tests)
- **Purpose**: Prevent regression of the original "traverseDefault is not a function" error
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should not throw "traverseDefault is not a function" error`
  - `should successfully traverse AST and find components`
  - `should handle traverse function correctly in queryComponents`
  - `should handle traverse function correctly in findPropUsage`

### 2. MCP Server Tool Interface Simulation (3 tests)
- **Purpose**: Test the exact calls that would be made by the MCP server
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should handle analyze_jsx_props tool call correctly`
  - `should handle query_components tool call correctly`
  - `should handle find_prop_usage tool call correctly`

### 3. Real-world Scenario Tests (3 tests)
- **Purpose**: Test scenarios that mirror actual usage patterns
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should handle the original user scenario: finding Select components with width props`
  - `should handle error conditions gracefully without crashing`
  - `should maintain consistent behavior across different working directories`

### 4. Performance and Memory Tests (2 tests)
- **Purpose**: Ensure the system can handle concurrent and rapid operations
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should handle large directory scans without memory issues`
  - `should handle rapid successive calls without issues`

### 5. Edge Case Coverage (2 tests)
- **Purpose**: Test various file types and JSX patterns
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should handle files with various JSX patterns`
  - `should handle TypeScript and JavaScript files equally`

### 6. Critical Babel Traverse Functionality Tests (3 tests)
- **Purpose**: Specifically test the Babel traverse functionality that was causing issues
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should successfully import and use traverse function`
  - `should handle AST traversal in all analyzer methods`
  - `should handle complex AST structures without traverse errors`

### 7. MCP Server Response Format Tests (2 tests)
- **Purpose**: Ensure all response formats work correctly with JSON serialization
- **Key Tests**:
  - `should generate MCP-compatible JSON responses`
  - `should handle MCP server error scenarios`

## Critical Tests That Would Have Caught the Original Issue

The following tests would have **failed** with the original Babel traverse import bug:

1. **`should not throw "traverseDefault is not a function" error`** - This test specifically checks for the exact error that was occurring
2. **`should successfully traverse AST and find components`** - This would have returned empty results due to the traverse error
3. **`should handle traverse function correctly in queryComponents`** - This would have thrown the traverse error
4. **`should successfully import and use traverse function`** - This directly tests the traverse import functionality
5. **`should handle the original user scenario`** - This would have returned `filesScanned: 0` due to the traverse error

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 54 (35 existing + 19 new integration tests)
- **All Tests Passing**: âœ…
- **Coverage**: Both unit tests and integration tests for MCP server functionality
- **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive coverage of the Babel traverse import issue

## Key Benefits

1. **Regression Prevention**: The tests will catch any future issues with Babel traverse imports
2. **Real-world Validation**: Tests simulate actual MCP server usage patterns
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all major functionality paths
4. **Performance Assurance**: Tests ensure the system can handle concurrent operations
5. **Error Handling**: Tests verify graceful handling of error conditions

## Files Modified
- `src/__tests__/mcp-server-integration.test.ts` - New comprehensive integration test suite
- All tests pass and provide confidence that the MCP server works correctly in production

The integration tests provide a safety net that would have caught the original issue and will prevent similar problems in the future.
